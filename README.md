This program used the two algorithms for permutations and combinations:

r-permutations: n! / (n - r)!
n-permutations: n! / r!(n - r)!

It used a for loop to calculate the factorials and assign them to variables. Since factorials
get large fast, BigInteger was used instead of ints or longs for the values. The program is 
unbreakeable no matter the input.

I ran several JUnit tests to make sure the method was successful.
